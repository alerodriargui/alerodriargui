## 🧠 About me

I'm a **developer & product builder** focused on:

- 🤖 **Trading bots & copy trading systems**
- 🔮 **Prediction markets (Polymarket, on-chain data)**
- ⚙️ **Automation, scraping & data pipelines**

I like to build **things that people actually use**, especially in crypto, finance and data-driven decision making.
